ML LAB project for LAB evaluation,
Creating a fake news detection app, A binary classification (REAL or FAKE) Could be used to eliminate mis-information.
We have used, Linear SVC, Logistic Reg, BNB(bernouli naive bayes) for classification, 
the accuracy for SVC and Log was high, therefore we have made a voting classifier with SVC and Log reg for classification.
